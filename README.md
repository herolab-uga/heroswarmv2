# heroswarmv2 - Fully-Capable Swarm robot design
This repository contains the open-sourced codes and hardware designs of the Swarm Robot (heroswarmv2) designed at the Heterogeneous Robotics Research Lab (HeRoLab) at the University of Georgia.

The robot is fully-capable in the following sense.

    ### Sensing: Multiple sensors such as proximity, RGB, sound, Inertial (IMU) altitude, and humidity and pressure measurements to capture local information; 
    ### Communication: Explicit data communication modalities such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; 
    ### Computing: High C1-level \cite{trenkwalder2019computational} computing through a Raspberry Pi Zero-based computing module that can support ROS and advanced programming; 
    ### Motion: Multi-level motor control with onboard wheel odometry aided by a microcontroller; 
    ### Power: Dedicated power management with different recharging variants such as inductive wireless charging or magnetic coupling.
